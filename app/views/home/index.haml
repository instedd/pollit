      .icon-container.left
        %span.i96grad-signature

      %h2 Identify Community Needs
      .icon-container.left
        %span.i96grad-folder
      %p Before allocating limited resources, it's important to understand the most pressing needs of your community. And no one knows those needs better than the people who make up that community. With Pollit, you can conduct a community poll with a minimum of time and other resources, assessing high-priority needs and interventions while identifying a critical mass of people willing to take action.

      %h2 Evaluating Program Success Rates
      .icon-container.left
        %span.i96grad-ok
      %p Oftentimes, the best way to know if you're making a difference is simply to ask. Ongoing evaluations can help you assess satisfaction, gather suggestions for continuous improvement, and measure program impact. With Pollit, you can collect monitoring and evaluation data at any time, in just a few easy steps, allowing you to frequently and cost-effectively evaluate -- and if needed, correct -- your current course.

      %h2 Assessing Knowledge
      .icon-container.left
        %span.i96grad-teach
      %p Today's learning builds on yesterday's, and that's why it's so important to ensure that students are keeping up. Regular knowledge assessment gives confidence to learners on the right track and highlights students who need a little more guidance. Using Pollit, you can measure knowledge before and after your class, program, or intervention, without extending class time or otherwise inconveniencing students.

      %h1 How does it work?
      %p All you need to get started is a questionnaire and a list of mobile phone numbers. You can create questionnaires using numeric, short answer, and/or multiple-choice questions. Once your questionnaire is ready to go, Pollit sends a text message invitation to each number on your list. Pollit sends your first question, waiting for an answer before sending another. Answers are stored in a spreadsheet, where you can review them in real time and export them for analysis in other applications.
